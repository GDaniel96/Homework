                <img src="image1.jpg">
                <p>The notion of appropriate technology was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as E.F.
                    Schumacher and Jacques Ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new
                    technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills
                    imported from elsewhere. The ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern.</p>

                <h3>Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century</h3>
                <hr>
                <img src="image2.jpg">
                <p>In his article, Jared Bernstein, a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy
                    Priorities,[53]
                    questions the widespread idea that automation, and more broadly, technological advances, have
                    mainly
                    contributed to this growing labor market problem. His thesis appears to be a third way between
                    optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between
                    technology and American issues concerning unemployment and declining wages.</p>

                <h3>Complex technological systems</h3>
                <hr>
                <img src="image3.jpg">
                <p>Thomas P. Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve
                    problems,
                    we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.[56] What is
                    the
                    difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove? Can
                    we
                    consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?

                    Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative
                    process
                    involving human ingenuity".[57] This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded
                    definitions that may mistakenly include cooking "technologies," but it also highlights the
                    prominent
                    role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological
                    systems.

                <h3>Science, engineering, and technology</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is
                    systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and
                    experimentation.[70] Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they
                    have
                    to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.[71]

                    Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit
                    natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques
                    from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including
                    scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some
                    practical result.</p>
